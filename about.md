# About me

I'm George, CTO at Hatchworks VC in Nicosia, Cyprus. I build AI products — **Zeig.ai**, which does financial analysis through conversation using multiple LLMs and vision AI, and **Spectre.ai**, a memory layer that gives AI agents persistent recall across sessions. Spectre ships with plugins for Claude Code and OpenCode today, with more on the way.

I've been writing software for about 15 years, and the stack has changed a few times. Started with PHP freelancing and alarm system installations (everyone has an origin story), moved through server infrastructure and datacenter work, spent five years building insurance systems, then shifted into blockchain gaming and DeFi. Now it's mostly LLMs, agent orchestration, and figuring out how to make AI tools that are actually useful rather than just impressive.

I also advise Phoenix, a DeFi liquidity provider, on protocol architecture and smart contracts.

I write occasionally about what I'm building and what breaks along the way - you can find that on [my blog](https://blog.violaris.org). Recent pieces include "The Model That Never Made a Trade" and "What We Learned Building Agent Memory at Scale."

On the academic side, I have a couple of peer-reviewed papers on P2P protocols and an out-of-band authentication model, from a time when I thought I might end up in research. I didn't, but the papers are still out there.

I'm also the proud dad of two awesome twin boys.
