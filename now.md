# Now

*Last updated: March 2026*

This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about). It's a snapshot of what I'm focused on right now.

## Working on

- **Zeig.ai** — AI-powered financial analysis platform. Multi-LLM pipelines, vision AI for document parsing, conversational interface over market data. Getting closer to something that genuinely replaces the analyst workflow rather than just augmenting it.
- **Spectre.ai** — persistent memory layer for AI agents. Ships as plugins for Claude Code and OpenCode. The goal is agents that actually remember what happened last session without you having to re-explain everything.
- **Open source** — maintaining [Smallwork](https://github.com/hatchworksvc/smallwork), [Vio](https://github.com/hatchworksvc/vio), and [ObsiTUI](https://github.com/hatchworksvc/obsitui). Smallwork is a PHP AI framework, Vio is an AI-first web framework, and ObsiTUI is a terminal-based Obsidian client with vim keybindings.

## Reading

- *(updating this soon — currently between books)*
- Recommendations welcome — [get in touch](mailto:george@violaris.org).

## Thinking about

- Agent memory architectures beyond simple vector search — retrieval is the easy part, knowing *what* to remember and *when* to forget is where it gets interesting.
- When reinforcement learning makes sense vs LLM tool-calling for trading decisions. The answer is "it depends" but the details matter a lot.
- How to make AI agents actually useful in production, not just demo-impressive. The gap between a cool prototype and something that works reliably at 3am is still enormous.
